This is a prorotyping workspace for the 8-bit computer I am trying to build.
To view the curcuit open it with logisim.

Currently, it has an ALU, a bus and a couple registers. 
It can add, subtract and multiply two 8-bit numbers. It can deal with negative numbers as well.
I am planning to add a memory and a control curcuit when I find the time.
